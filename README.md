# RoguelikeTutorial2021

A simple roguelike developed as I follow the 2021 r/RoguelikeDev tutorial series. The tutorials are found here: http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/2019/.
Note that I followed the 2019 version of the tutorial rather than the 2020 version, simply becuase that's where I originally started.

This is more for me to learn simple programming and roguelike dev concepts and skills, and may or may not grow beyond the tutorial scope.
